# Trimorph
Hello there!  I am a developer from Canada, who does professional freelance work with Minecraft Bukkit server plugins & web design.

I am currently interested in programming language theory and design, as well as compiler design.  In fact, I started developing my own programming language, as a hobby project, called Flycatcher.  Flycatcher is a statically typed, multi-paradigm, systems programming language.  The source code for [Flycatcher can be found here](https://github.com/redgush/flycatcher)  (it is currently in development and won't be finished for a while yet).
